# HID Controller support for USV Lir
This repository adds support for the Xbox wirelless controller to the control system of USV Lir using the Human Interface Protocol.
The controller will be connected via bluetooth to my Microbit interface moudle which expands the exsisting feature-set of the BBC Microbit by adding Wi-Fi and Bluetooth support, an LCD screen, servo motor connections, audio output, and serial comms.
